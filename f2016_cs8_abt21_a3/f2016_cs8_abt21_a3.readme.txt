Outline:

Import master input list
for file name in master input list
    open file
    extract name & distance (to a dictionary?)

(From previous assignment)
Count # of files read
Count total lines Read
Sum total distance
(New:)
    Max (all distances) - return max distance & participant name
    Min (all distances) - return min distance & participant name
    Count unique names

Print (as stated in assignment, use printkv function from previous)

For each participant in masterlist (dictionary)?
    Count # of appearances in list
    Report if > 1
    calculate total distance
Write to output file for each participant: Name,Count of entries, total distance

            Lookup key to see if it already exists
            If doesn't exist, create new key with value [] (empty list)
            Retrieve value (the list associated with the key)
            Use if value in to see if the value being checked exists in the list
            If the new value isn't in, .append() it
            (from stackoverflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16406329/python-dictionary-count-of-unique-values)

create a list of the names

d = {}
for name in names
    key = len(name)
    if key not in d:
        d[key] = []
    d[key].append(name)


    from collections import defaultdict
    masterdata = [(Mary,12.5),(John,15.2),(Mary,30.7),(Tom,120.6)]
    d = defaultdict(list)
    d
defaultdict(<type 'list'>,{})
    for name, dist in masterdata:
        d[name].append(dist)

For this program, I reused a significant amount of code from the third assignment, with the only change being the addition of the class
From the dictionary of unique participants that I created from all of the records, I took each key-value pair (name: [dist1, dist2, dist3,...]
and created a new instance of the class, Participant.

I then used the modules in the class to calculate the total distance for each individual and the number of runs
From a list of all class instances (all_p) I created the output to csv.

My approach to this assignment (and on the exam) is to first ask the user to input which measurement system
he or she wants to use, and then to ask for the distance driven and how much gasoline was used. I used an if statement
here for added user experience so that the desired units are included in the input prompt.

I then use if, elif, else to assign the input values to either metric or USC variables and then
convert that variable to the other system by defining variables for the other system. The else statement
is used to indicate that the user did not input one of the system options

Using the four variables (distance and gas used for each system) that I have just created in the first if statement
I will then calculate the fuel consumption for both systems

After computing the fuel consumption I then use if elif statements to determine the rating from the
consumption category table in the assignment

Finally, I'll print using the format function (9,.3) to create the proper formatting as required by the assignment
